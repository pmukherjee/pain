    <h2>Acute vs. Chronic</h2>
    <p>
   <span>
             Pain can be acute (short lived) or chronic (long lasting). Most pain is acute- like the pain you'd get if you broke your arm. Acute pain is a signal of an injury and the need to protect yourself by not using that arm until it has healed. When pain lasts more than 3 months, it is chronic.</br></br> Chronic pain is not an alert of more injury, even though you are still hurting.  It is like a broken car horn; you still hear the sound even though there is no danger. Stopping activity is not helpful. In fact, not moving enough causes your muscles to lose strength and become tight and sore, causing more pain. There are other ways the treatment of chronic and acute pain are different.</br></br>  When pain is acute, treatment may include rest and medication and possibly surgery.  When pain is chronic, medication may be part of treatment but the addition of pain management skills is also important. Many people with chronic pain get relief from medication, but they still have some remaining pain. Use of pain management skills, like those found in this app, can help you self-manage your pain. The pain management skills can help you find ways to be more active, exercise, stretch, manage stress, improve your sleep and support your mood; all of which will help to reduce your pain.
